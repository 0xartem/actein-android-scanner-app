<p>Actein Scanner continuously scans a square region shown on the screen - just line up the the qr code so it is completely inside the viewfinder rectangle:</p>
<p class="imgcenter"><img src="../images/demo-yes.png" style="padding:5px"/><img src="../images/demo-no.png" style="padding:5px"/></p>
<p>When a qr code is read, a beep sound will play and you'll see the results of the scan and description of what the qr code contains.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble scanning, make sure to hold the qr code steady. If the camera is unable to focus, try moving the qr code further or closer from the device.</p>
